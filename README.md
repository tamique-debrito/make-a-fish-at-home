# make-a-fish-at-home
This is a website which allows one who cannot afford the time coordination needed by makea.fish to enjoy the experience of generating a fish.

Background:
http://makea.fish/ is a website that allows you, at 11:11 each day, to make computer generated fishes. They look like this:

However, not everyone has the time or energy to wait around for 11:11 every day just to make a fish.
Enter my solution: "make a fish at home". This app provides users with the ability to make a fish whenever they want. And, to top it off, these fishes are much more creative and unique than those generated by the competitor website. Here are some examples of what they look like:
